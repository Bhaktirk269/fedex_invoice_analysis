BILLING CHANGE FEE 

Effective August 18, 2025, U.S. Inbound Processing Fee will increase for FedEx international shipments 
imported into the United States — excluding FedEx® International Connect Plus shipments, which are 
exempt from this fee. Visit our Shipping Rates & Tariffs | FedEx India for more details. 
Effective March 01, 2024, ‘Billing Change Fee’ of INR 700 + taxes will apply per rebilled invoice. The 
Billing Change Fee is chargeable over and above shipping charges when a customer requests a change 
in any defined billing information for a shipment after an invoice has been issued. 

To update the information on your FedEx shipping account, please email ininvoicequeries@fedex.com 
stating your FedEx account number and attach the relevant documents. FedEx will update your details 
by end of next working day. Updated details will apply to shipments (Air Waybills) generated 
subsequently for invoicing.
